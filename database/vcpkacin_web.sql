Anything?\r\n\r\nResearch tells us at least 70% of the people who find your site, after a quick once-over, they disappear… forever.\r\n\r\nThat means that all the work and effort you put into getting them to show up, goes down the tubes.\r\n\r\nWhy would you want all that good work – and the great site you’ve built – go to waste?\r\n\r\nBecause the odds are they’ll just skip over calling or even grabbing their phone, leaving you high and dry.\r\n\r\nBut here’s a thought… what if you could make it super-simple for someone to raise their hand, say, “okay, let’s talk” without requiring them to even pull their cell phone from their pocket?\r\n  \r\nYou can – thanks to revolutionary new software that can literally make that first call happen NOW.\r\n\r\nTalk With Web Visitor is a software widget that sits on your site, ready and waiting to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.

Anything?\r\n\r\nResearch tells us at least 70% of the people who find your site, after a quick once-over, they disappear… forever.\r\n\r\nThat means that all the work and effort you put into getting them to show up, goes down the tubes.\r\n\r\nWhy would you want all that good work – and the great site you’ve built – go to waste?\r\n\r\nBecause the odds are they’ll just skip over calling or even grabbing their phone, leaving you high and dry.\r\n\r\nBut here’s a thought… what if you could make it super-simple for someone to raise their hand, say, “okay, let’s talk” without requiring them to even pull their cell phone from their pocket?\r\n  \r\nYou can – thanks to revolutionary new software that can literally make that first call happen NOW.\r\n\r\nTalk With Web Visitor is a software widget that sits on your site, ready and waiting to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.

Anything?\r\n\r\nResearch tells us at least 70% of the people who find your site, after a quick once-over, they disappear… forever.\r\n\r\nThat means that all the work and effort you put into getting them to show up, goes down the tubes.\r\n\r\nWhy would you want all that good work – and the great site you’ve built – go to waste?\r\n\r\nBecause the odds are they’ll just skip over calling or even grabbing their phone, leaving you high and dry.\r\n\r\nBut here’s a thought… what if you could make it super-simple for someone to raise their hand, say, “okay, let’s talk” without requiring them to even pull their cell phone from their pocket?\r\n  \r\nYou can – thanks to revolutionary new software that can literally make that first call happen NOW.\r\n\r\nWeb Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that sits on your site, ready and waiting to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.

My name is Devarakonda Rakesh, and I am a former student of Vaageswari College of Engineering, Karimnagar, bearing Hallticket number 18S41A0218. I completed my B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) as part of the R18 batch from 2018 to 2022.\r\n\r\nI am writing to bring to your attention an issue I have been facing regarding the issuance of my Provisional Certificate (PC) and Consolidated Marks Memo (CMM). I had applied for grace marks for the subject \"High Voltage Engineering\" in November 2022. However, as of October 2023, I have not received my PC and CMM from the college.\r\n\r\nI have contacted the college administration multiple times to inquire about the status of my documents, but they have informed me that they have not received them from JNTUH. This situation is causing me great concern as I am in need of these documents for my career prospects. I have secured a software job, and they require me to undergo certificate verification. Without my PC and CMM, I am unable to proceed with this crucial step in my career.\r\n\r\nI attempted to contact JNTUH at the provided mobile number, 9491283135, but unfortunately, the number has consistently been switched off, making it impossible for me to reach them directly. Additionally, I sent an email regarding this matter, but I have not received a response.\r\n\r\nGiven that I reside in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, which is a considerable distance from my college, it is not feasible for me to visit the college in person on a daily basis to follow up on this issue. I am in a difficult situation and urgently require your assistance in resolving this matter.\r\n\r\nI kindly request your intervention and support in expediting the issuance of my PC and CMM. These documents are critical for my career progression, and any delay is causing significant stress and hindrance in my professional life.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if you could investigate this matter promptly and provide me with an update on the status of my documents or guide me on the necessary steps to expedite their issuance. Your assistance in resolving this issue is highly valued, and I hope for a swift resolution.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDevarakonda Rakesh\r\nMobile Number: 9515147103\r\nEmail:-rakeshdevarakonda2000@gmail.com\r\nHall Ticket-number:-18S41A0218\r\nVaageswari College of Engineering, Karimnagar', '2023-10-07 15:57:24', 1),
